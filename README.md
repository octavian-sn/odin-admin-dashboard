# odin-admin-dashboard
Project: Admin-Dashboard from TheOdinProject curriculum

The reason I have not changed the overall appearance of the dashboard from the on provided in the assignment, was because I considered the way it was setup, it was really good to practice the use of grid. 

I tried to organize the entire layout using only grid, even though at times I felt like using flexbox. This has really helped me in better understanding grid, and unexpectedly, flexbox too. There were situations where I felt like using flexbox for an easier and/or faster way to arrange something, but going out of my way to make it work with grid, helped me better to spot the differences between them and also to understand the situations where one would benefit more than the other. 

Overall is was a really enjoyable and informative project.
